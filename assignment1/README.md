## Goals

In this assignment we put together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
* Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
* Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
* Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.
* Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
* Implement and apply a Softmax
* Implement and apply a Two layer neural network
* Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
* Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features, etc.
